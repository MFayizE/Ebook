    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">A book that broke my heart and then stitched it back together, I adored It Ends With Us. A story that is <br> all too common and familiar and yet forbidden to be discussed and addressed, this is a brave attempt <br> by the author to bring forth an honest and unbiased picture of people who do and of people to whom <br> these things happen. We often hear incidents like the ones discussed in this book but how many times <br> does anyone truly understand the inner struggles of the people involved and their helplessness to get <br> out because they don’t have the support from friends, family, and society.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">"Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of <br> pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles,<br> rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet."</p>

    <h2>Things I liked</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">I laughed, cried, felt empowered, and then impressed as I followed Lily. I loved Ryle and Atlas, both <br> handsome and charismatic men but with one major difference that set them miles apart. Lily’s <br> relationship with both of them sets the pattern for the story and showcases two types of love, both <br> powerful but only one is the right kind.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">I am so happy I read this romance and I loved each character, Lily, Ryle, Atlas, Allysa, Marshall and Lily’s <br> mother. I was sad when the book ended because I wanted more. Hope CoHo writes about Lily again in <br> the future because I surely will be buying that book! <br> <br>
<br>
